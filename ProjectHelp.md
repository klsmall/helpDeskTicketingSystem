# UPDATED HELP:
*So basically, I will store the values obtained from the JSPs in the variables that you all define in your java classes. I will have to import your Java classes to do so. I will run a test later on tonight, and will show you all in class. Below are some links that should answer any questions:* 

## Java class in JSP
Here is a very basic example of how Java classes can be used in JSP. You can access this page [here](https://www.roseindia.net/jsp/simple-jsp-example/HowToUseAJavaClassMethodsInJsp.shtml). 

## Login and Logout Example in JSP
This page will help you to understand how your Java classes will link to the JSPs that I have created. Your Java classes and my JSPs will work together to handle the login and logout. You can access this page [here](https://www.javatpoint.com/login-form-in-jsp). 
 
##  Implementing "HelloCustomer" Application using JSP and Java
This page will also show you how I will use your pre-defined Java classes in the JSPs. You can access the page [here](http://openrules.com/InsideTrack/Tomcat/Part2.html). 

## Java EE Servlet/JSP tutorial: Building a simple listing in JSP
This is one last example. You can access the page [here](http://wiki4.caucho.com/Java_EE_Servlet/JSP_tutorial:_Building_a_simple_listing_in_JSP). 



**NOTE: If there is any confusion, you can simply search for JSP tutorials that addresses your problem.**
